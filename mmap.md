<warn>Work in progress</warn>

## `local mmap = require'mmap'`

Memory mapping API that can be used with Windows, Linux and OSX.

Features:

  * file-backed and pagefile-backed (anonymous) memory maps
  * read-only, read/write and copy-on-write access modes plus executable flag
  * name-tagged memory maps for sharing memory between processes
  * mirrored memory maps for using with [lock-free ring buffers][lfrb]
  * synchronous and asynchronous flushing
  * works with filenames, file objects, file descriptors and OS file handles.

Limitations:

  * I/O errors from accessing mmapped memory cause a crash.

### `mmap.map(args_t) -> map | nil,err,errcode` <br> `mmap.map(file, access, size, offset, addr, tagname) -> map | nil,err,errcode`

Create a memory map object. Args:

* `file`: the file to map: optional; if nil, a portion of the system pagefile
will be mapped instead; it can be:
	* a string representing the utf8 filename to open.
	* a number representing a file descriptor opened in a compatible mode.
	* a `FILE*` object opened in a compatible mode.
		* NOTE: `io.open()` returns a `FILE*` object in LuaJIT.
	* a `void*` representing a Windows HANDLE opened in a compatible mode.
* `access`: can be either:
	* '' (read-only, default)
	* 'w' (read + write)
	* 'c' (read + copy-on-write)
	* 'x' (read + execute)
	* 'wx' (read + write + execute)
	* 'cx' (read + copy-on-write + execute)
* `size`: the size of the memory segment (optional, defaults to file size).
	* if given it must be > 0 or an error is raised.
	* if not given, file size is assumed.
		* if the file is empty the mapping fails with `'file_too_short'` error.
	* if the file doesn't exist:
		* if write access is given, the file is created.
		* if write access is not given, the mapping fails with `'no_file'` error.
	* if the file is shorter than the required offset + size:
		* if write access is not given (or the file is the pagefile which
		can't be resized), the mapping fails with `'file_too_short'` error.
		* if write access is given, the file is extended.
			* if the disk is full, the mapping fails with `'disk_full'` error.
* `offset`: offset in the file (optional, defaults to 0).
	* if given, must be >= 0 or an error is raised.
	* must be aligned to a page boundary or an error is raised.
	* ignored when mapping the pagefile.
* `addr`: address to use (optional; an error is raised if zero).
* `tagname`: name of the memory map (optional; cannot be used with `file`;
must not contain slashes or backslashes): using the same name in two
different processes (or in the same process) gives access to the same memory.

Returns an object with the fields:

* `addr` - a `void*` pointer to the mapped memory
* `size` - the actual size of the memory block

If the mapping fails, returns `nil,err,errcode` where `errcode` can be:

* `'no_file'` - file not found.
* `'file_too_short'` - the file is shorter than the required size.
* `'disk_full'` - the file cannot be extended because the disk is full.
* `'out_of_mem'` - size or address too large or specified address in use.
* an OS-specific numeric error code.

#### NOTE

* write buffers are flushed before mapping an already-opened file.
* attempting to write to a memory block that wasn't mapped with write
or copy-on-write access results in a crash.
* changes done externally to a mapped file may not be visible immediately
(or at all) to the mapped memory.
* access to shared memory from multiple processes must be synchronized.


### `map:free()`

Free the memory and all associated resources and close the file
if it was opened by `mmap.map()`.


### `map:flush([async, ][addr, size]) -> true | nil,err,errcode`

Flush (part of) the memory to disk. If the address is not aligned,
it will be automatically aligned to the left. If `async` is true,
perform the operation asynchronously and return immediately.


### `mmap.unlink(filename)` <br> `map:unlink()`

Remove a (the) shared memory file from disk. When creating a shared memory
mapping using tagname, a file is created on the filesystem on Linux
and OS X (not so on Windows). That file must be removed manually when it is
no longer needed. If there's any consolation, this can be done anytime,
even while mappings are open and will not affect said mappings.


### `mmap.mirror(args_t) -> map | nil,err,errcode` <br> `mmap.mirror(file, size[, times[, addr]]) -> map | nil,err,errcode`

Create a mirrored memory mapping to use with a [lock-free ring buffer][lfrb].
Args:

* `file`: the file to map: required (the access is 'w').
* `size`: the size of the memory segment: required, automatically aligned
to the next page size.
* `times`: how many times to mirror the segment (optional, default: 2)
* `addr`: address to use (optional; can be anything convertible to `void*`).

The result is a table with `addr` and `size` fields and all the mirror map
objects in its array part (freeing the mirror will free all the maps).
The memory block at `addr` is mirrored such that
`(char*)addr[o1*i] == (char*)addr[o2*i]` for any `o1` and `o2` in
`0..times-1` and for any `i` in `0..size-1`.


### `mmap.aligned_size(bytes[, dir]) -> bytes`

Get the next larger (dir = 'right', default) or smaller (dir = 'left') size
that is aligned to a page boundary. It can be used to align offsets and sizes.


### `mmap.aligned_addr(ptr[, dir]) -> ptr`

Get the next (dir = 'right', default) or previous (dir = 'left') address that
is aligned to a page boundary. It can be used to align pointers.


### `mmap.pagesize() -> bytes`

Get the current page size. Memory will always be allocated in multiples
of this size and file offsets must be aligned to this size too.


### `mmap.filesize(file) -> size | nil,err,errcode`

Get file size. Can fail with `'not_found'` or an OS specific error code.


### `mmap.filesize(file, size) -> size | nil,err,errcode`

Enlarge or truncate a file to a specific size. If the file does not exist
it is created. Can fail with `'disk_full'` or an OS specific error code.
When enlarging, the appended data is undefined. When truncating, the data
up to the specified size is preserved.

__NOTE:__ Do not try to set the file size while the file is mapped.
Unmap it first, set the size, then map it back.
